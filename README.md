YBSwipeTableViewCell  
====================
A swiping table view cell inspired by iOS 7 Mail app's swipe to reveal options and Ash Furrow's UITableViewCell-Swipe-for-Options. This is a stripped-down version of what we use in our app [YNAB](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/you-need-a-budget-ynab/id372076250?mt=8)          
  
The swipe handler was inspired by some code I found on Github but can't remember now where it was :(    If you know the source, please let me know so I can attribute it accordingly.          
  
This implementation works with iOS 5 and later.
